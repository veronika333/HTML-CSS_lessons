              With a population of  over 1.5 million, Tbilisi is the capital and the largest city of Georgia. It is lying on both banks of the river Mtkvari among the hills. Tbilisi was set up in the 5th century by King Vakhtang I of Iberia (Vakhtang Gorgasali) and since then has been the home of multi-cultural and multi-ethnic people. It is predominantly an Orthodox Christian city, but can still boast having a Catholic church, Orthodox church, Synagogue, Minaret, and Gregorian church, all in one district.
           <br>
           <br>
           The legend says that king Vakhtang Gorgasali was hunting near the Mtskheta, the capital city, when his falcon caught an injured pheasant. Both birds fell into hot springs and died. When the king found the birds in the hot sulphur springs, he decided to build a new capital on that spot. He named the city – Tbilisi, which is derived from the Georgian word ‘Tbili’ which means warm.

<p class="text" style="opacity: 10;">
  Vardzia is a spectacular cave monastery near Aspindza in southern Georgia. It looks like one of the movie sets of Lord of the Rings, but it is not the home of dwarfs but of many monks. This underground monastery was built in the 12th Century, under the reign of King Tamar, the first woman that was ever crowned as a king (not a queen!) in Georgian history.
<br>
<br>
In the late 1100's the medieval kingdom of Georgia was constantly under threat of the Mongol Empire. To help her people avoid the Mongol onslaught, Tamar ordered the construction of an underground sanctuary and secretly they started building this fortress under the Erusheli mountain. It was a gigantic job but the people worked hard with the determination that their culture and lifestyle should not be destroyed by the invading Mongols.

<h2>Svaneti</h2>

<p>
  Svaneti is probably the most beautiful region of Georgia and the essence of what country can offer to the foreign tourists. All those stunning photos of historical stone villages, lush green valleys and snow-covered mountains.... the most of them were made here.

<br>
<br>
Svaneti region is situated in the northwestern Georgia along the southern slopes of Greater Caucasus mountains. It consists of two parts - Upper (Zemo) Svaneti and Lower (Kvemo) Svaneti. Upper Svaneti lies in the watershed of Enguri river. Surrounded by highest Georgian mountains, it is a popular tourist destination. Whenever you read in some foreign magazine about "Svaneti", the author actually means Upper Svaneti.

<h2>Racha</h2>

<p>
  A four hour drive and 300 km (190 mi) away from Tbilisi lies the region of Racha – a highland area located in northwestern Georgia. This place has always attracted Georgian and international tourists  and, with recent infrastructure investments, it’s popularity has been booming.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first place you should visit in Racha is Shaori – the largest lake in this region. In autumn, the colorful trees that reflect in the water create a fairy-tale land. In summer it is a welcomingly cool place for picnics. Fishermen appreciate Shaori as carp up to 10kg (22 lbs) are often caught in its waters. Ten minutes further into the heart of Racha and you will arrive at the village of Nikortmsinda where a 10th century temple is located and is currently a UNESCO World Heritage Site candidate.
