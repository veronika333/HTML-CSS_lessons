    <h1>Speech: "To be, or not to be, that is the question"</h1>
    BY <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare" target="_blank">WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</a><br />
    (<em>from</em> Hamlet, <em>spoken by Hamlet</em>)
    <br />
    <p>
      To be, or not to be: that is the question:
      <br />
      Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
      <br />
      The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
      <br />
      Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
      <br />
      And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
      <br />
      No more; and by a sleep to say we end
      <br />
      The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
      <br />
      That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
      <br />
      Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
      <br />
      To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
      <br />
      For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
      <br />
      When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
      <br />
      Must give us pause: there's the respect
      <br />
      That makes calamity of so long life;
      <br />
      For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
      <br />
      The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
      <br />
      The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
      <br />
      The insolence of office and the spurns <br />
      That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
      <br />
      When he himself might his quietus make
      <br />
      With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
      <br />
      To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
      <br />
      But that the dread of something after death,
      <br />
      The undiscover'd country from whose bourn <br />
      No traveller returns, puzzles the will <br />
      And makes us rather bear those ills we have <br />
      Than fly to others that we know not of? <br />
      Thus conscience does make cowards of us all; <br />
      And thus the native hue of resolution <br />
      Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,<br />
      And enterprises of great pith and moment <br />
      With this regard their currents turn awry, <br />
      And lose the name of action.--Soft you now! <br />
      The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons <br />
      Be all my sins remember'd!
